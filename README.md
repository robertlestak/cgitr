# cgitr

cgitr (copy git remote) enables you to quickly copy the git remote URL of the current repository to your clipboard.

## Functions

`gitr`		Output the git remote URL to `stdout`

`cgitr`		Copy the git remote URL to the clipboard

## Usage

`source` the path to `cigtr.sh` in your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`, or...).

Alternatively, you can run the `cgitr.sh` script itself within a git repository to immediately copy the remote URL to your clipboard without adding the functions to your shell.
